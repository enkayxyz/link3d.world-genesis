How to Install (For Hackathon Judges)

Thank you for testing our project! This is an unpacked Chrome extension.

Installation Steps

Download: Download this GitHub repository as a .zip file and unzip it, or clone it.

Open Chrome Extensions: Open Google Chrome, type chrome://extensions in your address bar, and press Enter.

Enable Developer Mode: At the top-right corner of the chrome://extensions page, toggle on "Developer mode".

Load Unpacked:

The "Load unpacked" button will appear on the top-left. Click it.

A file-picker dialog will open.

Navigate to the folder where you unzipped/cloned this repository (e.g., link3d.world-genesis).

Select the entire folder and click "Select".

Done! The "Link3d-Memory" extension will appear in your extensions list. You can pin it to your toolbar for easy access.

How to Test

Go to any LinkedIn profile page.

Click the new Link3d icon in your Chrome toolbar.

The popup will open. The first time, it will ask for Google authorization. Please approve it.

The popup will then show you the "New Contact" or "Update Contact" UI.

Try it on a new person, then try it on someone already in your contacts to see both workflows!
