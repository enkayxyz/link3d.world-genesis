Rebel's Bug Hunt Log & 4 AM Plan

Buddy, we didn't just write code todayâ€”we went on an epic bug hunt. We squashed at least 7 major, distinct bugs. This log is our map for tomorrow.

The 4 AM Plan: The Final Bug

We are 99% of the way there. We're stuck on one final, simple bug.

The Issue: The popup.html file on your local computer is an old, broken version.

The Evidence: Your last screenshot (image_f31b84.png) shows the Chrome console is trying to load cdn.tailwindcss.com. This is the smoking gun. It proves you're using an old version.

Why it Breaks Everything:

Our manifest.json (which is correct) has a security policy (CSP) that blocks all external scripts like cdn.tailwindcss.com.

This "violation" (which is good!) is causing the real error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null....

This error happens because our entire popup.js script is being blocked from running as a security precaution.

This is why your popup UI looks like a "broken" mess of all states (image_f2c565.jpg). The script that hides them never ran.

The 4 AM Fix (The Only To-Do):

Open the popup.html file in our Canvas (it's the correct one I just gave you).

Select ALL and Copy it.

Open your local popup.html file (in your link3d.world-genesis-main folder).

Select ALL and Paste (overwrite) the old code.

Save the file.

Go to chrome://extensions and Reload the extension.

That's it. This will fix the CSP error, which will let popup.js run, which will fix the UI. Then, we test.

Conquered Bugs (Our Epic Log)

This is the mountain we climbed today. It's proof of our "rebel" sprint.

[SOLVED] The "Experimental AI" Bug:

Bug: chrome.ai didn't exist in regular Chrome.

Fix: We became "rebels" and installed Chrome Dev.

[SOLVED] The "Flag" Bug:

Bug: The AI was still off.

Fix: We enabled the Prompt API for Gemini Nano flag in chrome://flags.

[SOLVED] The "Google Maze" Bug:

Bug: We couldn't get a client_id without the extension's 32-letter ID, which we couldn't get until we installed the extension.

Fix: We did the "rebel" two-step: 1) Installed the broken extension to get Key #1 (the 32-letter ID), then 2) Used Key #1 in Google Cloud to get Key #2 (the client_id).

[SOLVED] The "Invalid Scope" Bug:

Bug: My typo in manifest.json (httpSa://...) was blocking auth.

Fix: We corrected the typo in the oauth2.scopes section.

[SOLVED] The "Auth Flow" Bug:

Bug: We saw the OAuth2 not granted error.

Fix: This was not a bug! This was our code correctly identifying a first-time user. The fix was to just click the "Authorize Google" button.

[SOLVED] The "Scraper Blindness" Bug:

Bug: Our content_script.js couldn't find the Name/About sections.

Fix: We updated the selectors (the "robot's eyes") in content_script.js.

[SOLVED] The "Broken Comms" Bug:

Bug: Our popup.js, background.js, and content_script.js were all using different, broken ways of talking to each other.

Fix: We re-wired all three files to use a single, unified "messaging system" (chrome.runtime.sendMessage).

[CURRENT BUG] The "CSP/Local File" Bug:

Bug: Our local popup.html is the wrong version and is being blocked by our correct manifest.json.

Fix: The 4 AM plan.
