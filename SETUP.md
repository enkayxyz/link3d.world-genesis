# LinkedIn Profile to Google Contacts with AI - Setup Guide

This Chrome extension scrapes LinkedIn profile data, uses Chrome's built-in AI to summarize the "About" section, and syncs contacts to Google Contacts using the Google People API.

## Features

- âœ… Scrapes Name, Title, and About section from LinkedIn profiles
- âœ… Uses Chrome's built-in AI (`chrome.ai`) to generate professional summaries
- âœ… Integrates with Google Contacts via `chrome.identity` and People API
- âœ… Checks if contact already exists
- âœ… Creates new contacts with LinkedIn data and AI-generated memory
- âœ… Updates existing contacts by appending timestamped AI memories

## Prerequisites

1. **Chrome Browser** (version 115 or later recommended for MV3 support)
2. **Google Cloud Project** with Google People API enabled
3. **Chrome AI Origin Trial** token (optional, for AI features)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **Google People API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google People API"
   - Click "Enable"

4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Chrome Extension" as application type
   - Add your extension ID (you'll get this after loading the extension)
   - Add authorized scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts`

5. Update `manifest.json`:
   - Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com` with your actual client ID

### 2. Chrome AI Setup (Optional)

Chrome's built-in AI (`chrome.ai`) is currently in Origin Trial. To use it:

1. Sign up for the Origin Trial at [Chrome Origin Trials](https://developer.chrome.com/origintrials/)
2. Get your origin trial token
3. Add the token to your manifest.json (if required)

**Note**: The extension includes a fallback that creates summaries without AI if it's not available.

### 3. Load the Extension

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the extension directory

5. Copy the Extension ID from the extensions page
6. Update your Google Cloud OAuth credentials with this Extension ID

### 4. Update Icons (Optional)

The extension includes placeholder icons. For a professional look:

1. Create or download LinkedIn-themed icons in sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128 pixels
2. Replace the files in the `icons/` directory
3. Keep the filenames as: `icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`

## Usage

1. Navigate to any LinkedIn profile page (e.g., `https://www.linkedin.com/in/username`)
2. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
3. The extension will:
   - Scrape the profile name, title, and about section
   - Generate an AI summary of the about section
   - Check if the contact exists in Google Contacts
   - Show either "New Contact" or "Update Contact" button

4. Click **"New Contact"** to:
   - Create a new Google Contact
   - Add name, title, LinkedIn URL
   - Add AI-generated summary as biography/notes

5. Click **"Update Contact"** to:
   - Append a new timestamped AI memory to existing contact's notes
   - Preserve all existing contact information
