# LinkedIn Profile to Google Contacts with AI

Chrome AI Hackathon: A Chrome Manifest V3 extension using built-in AI to summarize LinkedIn profiles and sync them as "memories" to Google Contacts.

## Overview

This extension automates the process of saving LinkedIn connections to Google Contacts with AI-powered professional summaries. When you visit a LinkedIn profile, the extension:

1. **Scrapes** the profile's Name, Title, and About section
2. **Summarizes** the About section using Chrome's built-in AI
3. **Checks** if the contact already exists in Google Contacts
4. **Creates or Updates** the contact with all relevant information

1. Load the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Configure Google Cloud OAuth credentials
3. Visit any LinkedIn profile page
4. Click the extension icon to sync the contact
